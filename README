INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN ON WINDOWS

If you are running for the first time remember to install
requirements .txt in a venv

Also remember to run the query in query.sql file first in MySQL workbench. This creates a view that the API references. I did this because I did not have feedback from a higher up or front end developer so I did not know what columns would be important for the final query. In a professional setting I would narrow down the columns of the master query based on what columns are absoloutly necessary

1) Navigate to project directory in Command Prompt
2) Activate the virtual environment by running 
    $ venv\Scripts\activate
3) Run the following commands
    $ set FLASK_APP=flaskr
    $ set FLASK_ENV=development
4) Start the server by running
    $ flask run
