Notes:
I ran the sql code provided and created the database
on my local machine using MySQLWorkbench
The database connection code is specific to my 
local machine. 
In a production environment I assume that the 
database would be hosted on another server.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN ON WINDOWS

If you are running for the first time remember to install
requirements .txt 
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Also remember to run the query in query.sql file first in MySQL workbench. This creates a view that the API references. I did this because I did not have feedback from a front end developer, so I did not know what columns would be important for creating the front end. In a professional setting I would narrow down the columns of the master query based on what columns are absoloutly necessary

1) Navigate to project directory in Command Prompt
2) Activate the virtual environment by running 
    $ venv\Scripts\activate
3) Run the following commands
    $ set FLASK_APP=flaskr
    $ set FLASK_ENV=development
4) Start the server by running
    $ flask run
